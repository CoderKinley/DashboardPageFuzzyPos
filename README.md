🔌 API Integration
The dashboard is expected to consume data from a backend (Node.js, PHP, or Firebase).
Ensure the API endpoints are properly set in services/api.js (or similar). Example:
javascriptconst BASE_URL = "http://yourbackend.com/api";

// Example endpoint
const fetchBillSummary = async () => {
  return axios.get(`${BASE_URL}/bill-summary`);
};
